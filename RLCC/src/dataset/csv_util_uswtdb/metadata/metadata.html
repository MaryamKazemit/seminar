						Title: 
					</span><span>U.S. Wind Turbine Database, Minnesota and National</span></div><br><div class="mgmgel"><span>
						Abstract: 
					</span><span>This dataset provides locations and technical specifications of wind turbines in the United States, almost all of which are utility-scale. Utility-scale turbines are ones that generate power and feed it into the grid, supplying a utility with energy. They are usually much larger than turbines that would feed a homeowner or business.
<br>
<br><b>The data formats downloadable from the Minnesota Geospatial Commons contain just the Minnesota turbines. Data, maps and services accessed from the USWTDB website provide nationwide turbines.</b>
<br>
<br>The regularly updated database has wind turbine records that have been collected, digitized, and locationally verified. Turbine data were gathered from the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Digital Obstacle File (DOF) and Obstruction Evaluation Airport Airspace Analysis (OE-AAA), the American Wind Energy Association (AWEA), Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), and the United States Geological Survey (USGS), and were merged and collapsed into a single data set.
<br>
<br>Verification of the turbine positions was done by visual interpretation using high-resolution aerial imagery in Esri ArcGIS Desktop. A locational error of plus or minus 10 meters for turbine locations was tolerated. Technical specifications for turbines were assigned based on the wind turbine make and models as provided by manufacturers and project developers directly, and via FAA datasets, information on the wind project developer or turbine manufacturer websites, or other online sources. Some facility and turbine information on make and model did not exist or was difficult to obtain. Thus, uncertainty may exist for certain turbine specifications. Similarly, some turbines were not yet built, not built at all, or for other reasons cannot be verified visually. Location and turbine specifications data quality are rated and a confidence is recorded for both. None of the data are field verified.
<br>
<br>The U.S. Wind Turbine Database website provides the national data in many different formats:  shapefile, CSV, GeoJSON, web services (cached and dynamic), API, and web viewer. See:  <a target="_blank" href="https://eerscmap.usgs.gov/uswtdb/">https://eerscmap.usgs.gov/uswtdb/</a> 
<br>
<br>The web viewer provides many options to search; filter by attribute, date and location; and customize the map display. For details and screenshots of these options, see:  <a target="_blank" href="https://eerscmap.usgs.gov/uswtdb/help/">https://eerscmap.usgs.gov/uswtdb/help/</a>

<br>------------
<br>This metadata record was adapted by the Minnesota Geospatial Information Office (MnGeo) from the national version of the metadata. It describes the Minnesota extract of the shapefile data that has been projected from geographic to UTM coordinates and converted to Esri file geodatabase (fgdb) format. There may be more recent updates available on the national website. Accessing the data via the national web services or API will always provide the most recent data.<br></span></div><br><div class="mgmgel"><span>
						Purpose: 
					</span><span>The purpose of this information is to provide a regularly updated, publicly available, spatially referenced, national dataset made up almost entirely of utility-scale wind turbine locations and their technical specifications. An appropriate use of the data would be for scientific analysis, research or for general interest for the public. Identification of turbines that have been retrofitted, repowered, decommissioned, and/or removed is a continual ongoing effort; thus, the dataset may contain turbines that were previously verified and subsequently removed.</span></div><br><div class="mgmgel"><span>

</a><br>The latest release includes data on 73,352 turbines covering 43 states (plus Guam and PR). The most recent turbines added to the USWTDB became operational as recently as the second quarter of 2023, with a few from the third quarter of 2023. The oldest turbines in the data set were installed prior to 1990. USWTDB releases generally lag installations by one quarter to allow for merging of the various datasets, visual verification, and quality control.</span></div><br><div class="mgmgel"><span>

					Section 2: Data Quality
				</h2><div class="mgmgel"><span>
						Attribute Accuracy: 
					</span><span>Turbine data points were spatially verified in aerial imagery to confirm or edit their correct position. The map scale used while verifying and digitizing turbines depended on location, need, and imagery availability. Authors used aerial imagery with a typical assessment map scale of 1:2,000 to 1:5,000, none of the spatial verification was done at a map scale smaller than 1:5,000. Uncertainty may exist for certain turbine locations as indicated in confidence turbine location field (t_conf_loc). Uncertainty in turbine specifications was indicated in the confidence of attribute field (t_conf_atr).</span></div><br><div class="mgmgel"><span>
						Logical Consistency:
					</span><span>No formal logical accuracy tests were conducted.</span></div><br><div class="mgmgel"><span>
						Completeness:
					</span><span>Data set is considered complete for the information presented, as described in the abstract. It is regularly updated and turbines will be added and removed over time, and characteristics might be altered over time as well. Users should be aware that the location data was based on a snapshot of time; turbines could have been removed after that time or built since the image date. None of the data are field verified.</span></div><br><div class="mgmgel"><span>
						Horizontal Positional Accuracy:
					</span><span>The wind turbine points were horizontally verified with aerial imagery as specified in the image source attribute. NAIP provides 1 meters ground sample distance orthoimagery to within plus or minus 6 meters to true ground at a 95-percent confidence level. The Bing Maps Aerial basemaps and Digital Globe imagery have a variable resolution and accuracy based on image source, type, and location. The Bing Maps Aerial basemaps horizontal accuracy for CONUS is estimated to be 0.3m to 0.03m. Digital Globe imagery is estimated to be 0.3m to 0.03m.</span></div><br><div class="mgmgel"><span>
								Vertical Positional Accuracy:
							</span><span>A formal accuracy assessment of the vertical positional information in the data set has either not been conducted, or is not applicable.</span></div><br><div class="mgmgel"><span>
						Lineage:
					</span><span><b>National dataset sources and processing steps:</b>
<br>
<br>The USWTDB combines a 2014 USGS data set (48,956 wind turbines, including decommissioned and duplicate turbines) with a 2017 LBNL data set (43,827 wind turbines) and includes regular updates from AWEA’s WindIQ as well as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Digital Obstacle File (DOF) and Obstacle Evaluation Airport Airspace Analysis (OE-AAA). The USWTDB is updated as frequently as quarterly as new data become available and will lag installations by approximately one quarter.
<br>
<br>All turbine points in the data set are visually verified using high-resolution aerial imagery in ESRI ArcGIS Desktop, and X/Y locations are manually moved to the base of the turbine with an estimated locational tolerance of 10 meters. Visual verification also enables identification and removal of duplicate turbine points and decommissioned turbines from the database, although some decommissioned turbines likely have not yet been identified and thus remain in the data set. Moreover, because of a lag in obtaining up-to-date aerial imagery, some turbine locations have not been visually verified.
<br>
<br>Technical specifications for turbines are assigned based on turbine make and model as described in literature, specifications listed in the FAA DOF, and collected via AWEA, LBNL, and turbine manufacturer websites. Because some make and model information does not exist or is difficult to obtain, uncertainty may exist for certain turbine specifications.
<br>
<br>The uncertainties associated with location and attribute data quality are rated, and a confidence level is recorded. None of the data in the USWTDB are field verified.

<br>
<br>
<br><b>Minnesota dataset source and processing steps:</b>
<br>
<br>The most recent shapefile was downloaded from the U.S. Wind Turbine Database website. All turbines in Minnesota (t_state = MN) were selected and saved as a separate file. That file was projected to UTM NAD83 coordinates using Esri's ArcGIS desktop software, then converted to file geodatabase format.
